macOS is a script - written in pure bash - to set up a macOS laptop with my opinionated configurations.

It can run multiple times on the same machine safely.

Requirements
------------

macOS supports:

* macOS Sierra (10.12)

Older versions may work but aren't regularly tested. Bug reports for older
versions are welcome.

Install
-------

Download, review, then execute the script:

```
sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicholasadamou/macos/master/macos
bash macos
```

It should take less than a minute to install.
